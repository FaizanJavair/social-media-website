# social-media-website
Group project called Frnds which is a simple social media website.
This is a Social Media I worked on with a team of 3 people as part of our 2nd year Project. I mainly focused on Front-end Development which included
HTML, CSS, JS and Bootstrap to make the front-end of the website.
The website uses Python, Flask, MariaDB for the back-end!
